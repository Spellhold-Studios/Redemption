@200  = ~I can feel the currents of energy whirling in me, my goddess! Ah! It feels so good – it is almost divine! I shall do as you ask, new Mistress, if I can drink more from the source of your power and be restored.~ [BODHIX04]
@201  = ~It is soo amusing to see you switch sides again, brother dear. So you have found it easier to consort with a complete loser like yourself than to bend your stiff neck before the real power? How do you fare, <CHARNAME>? It’s nice to see you in perfect health, since I find sickly prey utterly distasteful, if you forgive my pun.~ [BODHIX05]
@202  = ~Still trapped in servitude, if not to Irenicus then to the first psycho with a loud voice and a bit of power, eh Bodhi? I gather you have very little character of your own since you always merrily reflect that of your current master. Forgive me, but Melissan is an even poorer choice than your distinguished brother. And the last time I saw you, you looked like a freshly skewered side of beef yourself.~
@203  = ~Well, well, well...if the Child of Bhaal hasn't gone and found <PRO_HIMHER>self a sense of humour.  Did <PRO_HESHE> dig it up all by <PRO_HIMHER>self, dear brother, or did you implant it in <PRO_HIMHER> in one of your more bizarre experiments? I wish it was the later, since all your tricks with knives are so sinfully delicious.~ [BODHIX42]
@204  = ~How very like you to deny me my restoration!  You’ve always treated me like so much dirt on your boots, “brother”! Or do you think I shall be forever satisfied with your leavings?~ [BODHIX31]
@205  = ~You had your chance, brother.  Your plans failed, as I recall, and brought about my death.  Now you are weak, and my new Mistress is strong, and it is she that shall give me what I need! I look forward to bathing in your blood, dear brother ... a suitable reward for your utter failure!~

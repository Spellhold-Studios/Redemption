@420  = ~As the spell is cast, Irenicus is enveloped in its bright radiance. He screams terribly and you see him clawing at his leather hood as if he is fighting for breath. His gloves are gone, and as you watch in horror the mask too crumbles under his bloody fingers, revealing something you have not expected ... a wave of hair, pale as the moonlight, and a face young and stunningly beautiful ... yet haughty and arrogant, with the high cheekbones and long delicate ears of an elf. Strangely, the features that emerge from the filthy mess of cracked leather resemble that of the mask ... as much as a newly hatched butterfly resembles its dry, shriveled cocoon, or the face of a living person resembles their postmortem plaster cast...~
@421  = ~You shiver at the thought of him crafting that macabre visage from the memory of an image that he had seen in a mirror every day of his former life. While you watch the transformation in morbid fascination, the solar raises her eerie voice in another enchantment. The elven renegade jerks as if stricken by lightning and trashes violently, his head snaps back and forth as that of a marionette. Screams and pleas of mercy weak like the mewling of a kitten freeze on his lips; his face is now twisted in a contorted grimace of a man stretched on a torturer’s rack. You have a nauseating feeling that you are watching an execution rather than a healing, and the shrieks that issue from his mouth are not human anymore, but resemble those of an animal being flayed alive. You avert your eyes wishing that the mage, whom you even now cannot forgive for what he did to you and your friends, would lose consciousness. But your divine sense tells you that the solar is keeping him fully aware of what is happening to him.~
@422  = ~You do not know how much time passes in this manner, as the flow of time in this place - a small pocket Plane called the Throne of Bhaal - is strange... It can be days or eons, although for you and your companions it is merely a few moments. You know though that the tortured man is locked in his own time-space continuum, separate from the rest of the Universe. His bright blue eyes stay wide open through his entire experience, and what is reflected in there is more terrifying than all the horrors of the Abyss... When it is finally over the one you called Irenicus slumps to the floor, supple as a rag doll, and stays very still.~
